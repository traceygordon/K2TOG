Clone the Repository
To clone the repository using SSH, use the command:
sh
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
Replace username and repository with the appropriate account and repository name.

Check Your Remote Configuration
After cloning, itâ€™s a good idea to verify that the remote URL is set up correctly:
sh
cd repository
git remote -v

You should see something like this, indicating that you are configured to use SSH:
origin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/repository.git (push)

Fetch and Sync with the Main Branch
Before you start making changes, it's good practice to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and synchronize with the main branch. If you're using multiple branches, you might want to check out the branch you're supposed to work on:
git fetch origin
git checkout main  # or checkout whatever branch you are supposed to be working on
git pull origin main  # or git pull origin <branch-name>

Create a New Branch for Your Changes
When collaborating, it's best to create a separate branch for your changes. This helps keep your work organized and doesn't disrupt the main branch:
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
Use a branch name that reflects the purpose of your work (e.g., feature/add-login, bugfix/fix-typo, etc.).

Make Your Changes
Now, you can proceed to make your changes in the codebase.

Stage and Commit Your Changes
After making your changes, you'll want to stage and commit them:
git add .
git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
Push Your Changes to GitHub

Once your changes are committed locally, push them to the remote repository. Make sure your new branch is pushed:
git push origin feature/my-feature

Open a Pull Request (PR)
After pushing your changes, navigate to the GitHub repository in your web browser. You should see an option to create a pull request with your newly pushed branch. Create a PR to initiate a review of your changes by your collaborators.
